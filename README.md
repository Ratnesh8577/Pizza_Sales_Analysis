# Business Objectives

2) Determine sales distribution by pizza category, size, and type.
3) Analyse time-based trends in sales (daily, monthly, and yearly).
4) Highlight best-selling and least-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity.
5) Understand customer purchasing behaviour through Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Pizza per Order.
6) Provide visualization dashboards for effective decision-making.

# Business Questions Answered
1) What is the total revenue generated?
2) How many pizzas were sold in total?
3) Which category and size of pizzas perform best?
4) Which pizzas are the top and bottom performers?
5) What is the average order value and average pizzas per order?
